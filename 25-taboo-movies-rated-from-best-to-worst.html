These movies push the limits of sexually offensive activities and general life experiences to the extreme.</strong></p><p><strong>Films that fall into this category run the gamut from smutty art house movies to cult classics productions, and they are considered to be taboo based on existing laws, social rules, religious doctrines, as well as individual conscience.</strong></p><h3><strong>1. Murmur of the Heart</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/R-1024x576.jpg><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 1971</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 7.6/10</li></ul><p>Occupying the number one spot among our list of taboo movies is the comedy, Murmur of the Heart – a 1971 film written and directed by Louis Malle. The movie is set in France towards the end of the Indochina War. It stars actors like Lea Massari, Benoît Ferreux, and Daniel Gélin.</p><p>This taboo movie revolves around Laurent Chevalier – a 14-year-old boy who spent much of his growing-up years in the bourgeois environs of Dijon, France. As the plot unfolds, it reveals Laurent’s father, Charles, to be an uncaring and indifferent dad, and his mother, Clara, who is Italian is so caring and affectionate.</p><p>However, the teenage boy soon discovered that his mum’s loving nature was just a façade as she was carrying on an adulterous affair with a man. Enraged by his discovery, Laurent ran to his dad to spill the beans but was angrily turned away as Charles was very busy. The boy soon found solace in vices like masturbation and shoplifting. He later found himself at a brothel courtesy of his brothers and lost his virginity to Freda – a prostitute at the shady facility.</p><h3><strong>2. Carol</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2015</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 7.2/10</li></ul><p>The drama film, Carol, is set in 1950s New York. The storyline of this Todd Haynes-directed production is based on Theresa – a shy lass that wasn’t satisfied with her boyfriend.</p><p>The plot also revealed Carol, an affluent middle-aged mother who was on the verge of divorcing her husband of many years. Though these two characters come from different strata of society, they had one thing in common. The world around them proved to be totally indifferent and cold to their desires and feelings, and it was at this point, they crossed paths for the first time.</p><p>With a stellar cast comprising Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, and Sarah Paulson, Haynes crafted a timeless tale of love full of humanity and warmth. Carol is a beautiful movie about the true meaning of falling in love. It was well received by the viewing public, sweeping many prestigious awards and nominations after it hit the movie stand. A six-time Oscars nominee, with 225 nominations and 76 wins, is a record too high for others to break.</p><h3><strong>3. Irina Palm</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2007</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 7.2/10</li></ul><p>Directed by Sam Garbarski, Irina Palm is a comedy-drama film that centers on the life of a middle-aged widow known as Maggie. Short of cash, Maggie desperately needed to raise funds for Olly’s (her grandson’s) special medical treatment. Roaming the streets of London after several unsuccessful attempts to get hold of cash, she stumbles on an ad reading “Hostess wanted” in the window of a sex club called Sexy World.</p><p>On entering the shop, the shop owner Micky employed Maggie’s services and she was handed to Luisa, who went ahead to give her the necessary training for the job. Notable among her training is giving a”handjob” via a hole in a wall; this is called a glory hole. Though Maggie hesitated at first, she soon became adept at the job but kept it hidden from her son, Tom, and his wife, Sarah, which led to very uncomfortable situations.</p><p>This Sam Garbarski-directed movie stars the likes of Marianne Faithfull Predrag ‘Miki’ Manojlovic and Kevin Bishop. It was nominated for awards seven times and got seven wins.</p><h3><strong>4. Delta</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Release Date</strong>: 2008</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 6.3/10</li></ul><p>Situated in Hungary, Delta is a drama movie that explores an emotionally incestuous relationship between two siblings – a brother and a sister.</p><p>A man who has been estranged from his family comes home to discover that his mum has taken a lover and his sister was all grown up. He went ahead to build his home in the Delta to put down roots, but tragic consequences abound after his sister moved into his home and they commenced a romantic relationship.</p><p>The movie possesses this eerie dark tone, reflecting the strange relationship between the two characters. Throughout the movie, you will feel a lurking danger, but the manner in which the characters and their incestuous relationship are portrayed will arouse empathy in the viewers rather than put them off.</p><p>Kornél Mundruczó directed the film starring Félix Lajkó, Orsolya Tóth, and Lili Monori. Nominated for seven awards, it won seven.</p><h3><strong>5. My Brother Tom</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2001</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 6.8/10</li></ul><p>Our list of Taboo movies goes on to include My Brother Tom. The Dom Rotheroe-directed taboo relationship film reveals two teenagers – Jessica and Tom who embarked on a forbidden relationship.</p><p>The duo constantly faced abuse from the people they should trust – while Tom was constantly bullied by a notorious local gang and sexually abused by his own dad, Jessica’s teacher, and close neighbor, Jack was also subjecting her to all sorts of abuses. The two teens joined forces and bonded in the woods, building a private reality that no other person can penetrate.</p><p>Jenna Harrison, Ben Whishaw, and Honeysuckle Weeks starred in the movie and it recorded eight wins and four nominations.</p><h3><strong>6. Shame</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2011</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 7.2/10</li></ul><p>In this taboo movie, Shame, we will meet a notorious sex addict who goes by the name of Brandon in the leading position. Brandon prides himself on having a carefully cultivated private life. However, his cover falls apart after his blood sister came to his house to stay indefinitely. Brandon started facing his worst fears as the plot unfolds.</p><p>Directed by Steve McQueen, Shame was co-written by Steve McQueen and Abi Morgan and stars Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, and James Badge Dale. It was a two-time nominee for BAFTA Awards, swept 94 other nominations, and won 50 prestigious awards.</p><h3><strong>7. Mississippi Masala</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 1991</li><li><strong>Ratings:</strong> 6.7/10</li></ul><p>This romantic drama film centers on racism. Indian culture forbids women from getting married outside their cultural boundaries but a woman of Indian origin found love in the arms of a Black man.</p><p>It happens after an Indian family was expelled from Uganda in 1972 by Idi Amin.
