We are quite familiar with the American Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</a> that originates from England.</p><p>There is debate as to how the Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier came to exist. Some believe that this breed doesn’t exist and they are simply American Pit Bull Terriers, just named differently to circumnavigate breed-specific legislation in Europe.</p><h2><span id=Breed_Overview>Breed Overview</span></h2><p>Height:</p><p>17 – 24 inches</p><p>Weight:</p><p>55 – 75 pounds</p><p>Lifespan:</p><p>10 – 15 years</p><p>Colors:</p><p>Black, blue, fawn, red, white, or brindle, often with markings</p><p>Suitable for:</p><p>Active families, houses with yards, guard duty, those looking for a low-shedding dog, experienced dog owners</p><p>Temperament:</p><p>Friendly, loyal, docile, playful, tenacious, protective, powerful</p><p>The Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors and patterns and is an overall healthy breed that can live up to 15 years. They have a stocky, muscular appearance standing no more than 24 inches at the shoulder and weighing anywhere from 55 to 75 pounds.</p><p>Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers, like all the other versions of Bull Terrier, are misunderstood because they were originally bred for fighting and are often victims of poor socialization and lack of training. These beautiful, muscular dogs can grow up to be wonderful pets. They are loyal, playful, friendly, and protective of their people. They can even be docile couch potatoes once they get their daily exercise in.</p><h2><span id=Irish_Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier_Characteristics>Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier Characteristics</span></h2><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Energy:</span></p><p>+</p><p>High-energy dogs will need a lot of mental and physical stimulation to stay happy and healthy, while low-energy dogs require minimal physical activity. It’s important when choosing a dog to make sure their energy levels match your lifestyle or vice versa.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Trainability:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Easy-to-train dogs are more skilled at learning prompts and actions quickly with minimal training. Dogs that are harder to train will require a bit more patience and practice.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Health:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Some dog breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, and some more than others. This doesn’t mean that every dog will have these issues, but they have an increased risk, so it’s important to understand and prepare for any additional needs they may require.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Lifespan:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Some breeds, due to their size or their breeds potential genetic health issues, have shorter lifespans than others. Proper exercise, nutrition, and hygiene also play an important role in the lifespan of your pet.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Sociability:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Some dog breeds are more social than others, both towards humans and other dogs. More social dogs have a tendency to run up to strangers for pets and scratches, while less social dogs shy away and are more cautious, even potentially aggressive. No matter the breed, it’s important to socialize your dog and expose them to lots of different situations.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=Irish_Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier_Puppies>Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier Puppies</span></h2><p>The Irish Staffordshire Terrier is not a breed for everyone. To be the best companions and live up to their wonderful family-dog potential,&nbsp;these dogs will require more experienced owners that have the time and patience to put into proper socialization and training.</p><p>Because they were bred to fight, they don’t always do well with other dogs and pets. You must socialize them from early puppyhood and remain consistent throughout their lives.</p><p>Additionally, due to their athleticism, they are not a great choice for those that live in small apartments or have a busy lifestyle. They will do best with owners that have time to dedicate to their exercise needs.</p><p>This breed is also very attached to its family and is known to experience separation anxiety. You’ll want to train them early to feel comfortable with you leaving the home to avoid the stress and anxiety they can experience.</p><h2><span id=i><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></h2><h2><span id=Temperament_Intelligence_of_the_Irish_Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier>Temperament & Intelligence of the Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier</span></h2><p>Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers are loyal dogs that will go to great lengths to defend their family. A protector by nature, this breed will fight to protect its family and will be very committed to doing so. If it feels anything is threatening its family, it can become aggressive toward the perceived threat.</p><p>They are a very social breed and love to interact with people. They usually take very well to strangers and are only defensive and protective if they feel there is a threat present. There have been poor breeding practices that have resulted in aggression and behavioral issues.</p><p>Though they were bred to be fighters and it is best to be cautious around other animals, they were also bred to be submissive and responsive to humans and are very eager to please. They are incredibly loving and affectionate with their families. You can also expect them to be a bit silly. Their goofy personalities can be quite entertaining!</p><p>Despite their reputation, if given the proper socialization and training they can make great pets that will work their way into your heart almost immediately.</p><h3><span id=Are_These_Dogs_Good_for_Families>Are These Dogs Good for Families? 👪</span></h3><p>The Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier has the potential to be great with kids. As with any dog, it is best to socialize them from an early age. This breed is very friendly, playful, and lovable.

They will shed their coat so you can expect to find short hairs all over the house, especially during periods of high shedding, such as springtime. Occasional brushing will suffice and can help with loose hairs. This breed will do fine with occasional baths, but it won’t be a frequent requirement.</p><p>It’s a good idea to have your dog accustomed to getting its teeth brushed weekly and its nails trimmed every month.

It’s also very important to spay your female, as it can help prevent diseases, such as cancer as they get older. Females tend to be very motherly and protective with children.
